Got it — let’s break this down step by step so you can fix the errors and get your Vercel deployment working.

---

## ✅ **What’s Happening**

Your Vercel build log shows:

* The **frontend** build using **Vite** finished **successfully**.
* The **server build step** (using `esbuild` on your `server/index.ts`) failed with **two syntax errors**.

---

## 🗂️ **Key Errors**

**1️⃣ Error 1 — Expected `;` but found `.`**

```
server/database-storage.ts:271:11:
  271 │     console.log(`🔍 [DEBUG] Starting collaboration network gene...
```

**Root cause:**
This means on line 271, `console.log` is not properly closed.
The parser expects a semicolon `;` but sees something else — likely you forgot to close the backtick **(`)** or the parenthesis **`)\`**.

---

**2️⃣ Error 2 — Unexpected `catch`**

```
server/storage.ts:510:6:
  510 │     } catch (error) {
```

**Root cause:**
This means `catch` is not attached to a valid `try` block.

The compiler sees `} catch` but no `try { ... }` before it.
This happens when:

* You forgot `try {` above.
* Or there’s a syntax error breaking the `try` block.
* Or there’s a missing `{` or `}` earlier.

## 🧩 **How to Fix**

### 🔍 **1. Fix the `console.log`**

Go to:

```ts
// server/database-storage.ts
// Around line 271
console.log(`🔍 [DEBUG] Starting collaboration network gene...
```

✅ **What to do:**

* Make sure the string literal closes with **\`**.
* Make sure the parenthesis `)` is closed.
* Add `;` at the end.

**Example fix:**

```ts
console.log(`🔍 [DEBUG] Starting collaboration network generation...`);
```

---

### 🔍 **2. Fix the `try...catch`**

Go to:

```ts
// server/storage.ts
// Around line 510
} catch (error) {
```

✅ **What to do:**

* Confirm there’s a `try {` **before** it.

* Example:

  ```ts
  try {
    // do something risky
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
  ```

* If you only have:

  ```ts
  someCode();
  } catch (error) {
  ```

  Then you must wrap `someCode();` inside `try { ... }`.

## 🧹 **Bonus — Fix Browserslist Warning**

The build log says:

```
Browserslist: browsers data (caniuse-lite) is 9 months old. Please run:
  npx update-browserslist-db@latest
```

This won’t break your build, but you can silence it by running:

```bash
npx update-browserslist-db@latest
```

And then commit the updated `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`.

## ⚙️ **Checklist**

✅ Fix `console.log`
✅ Fix `try { } catch`
✅ Push the changes → new PR or merge
✅ Re-deploy on Vercel
