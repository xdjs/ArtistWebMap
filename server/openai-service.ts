Please respond with JSON in this exact format:

Important guidelines:
- Include up to 10 music industry professionals who have actually worked with ${artistName}
- For each person, specify their MAIN role when working with ${artistName}: "producer", "songwriter", or "artist"
- If Jack Antonoff primarily produced for ${artistName}, list him as "producer" only (not both producer and songwriter)
- Include their top 3 collaborating artists for each person
- Focus on real, verified collaborations from the music industry`;
